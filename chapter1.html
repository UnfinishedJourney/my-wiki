    <h1>Chapter 1: Discovering Today</h1>
    <p>One of the differences between movie-quality rendering and real-time rendering is geometric complexity; movies generally have much higher geometric detail.
       To improve geometric detail in real-time rendering, tessellation can be done in hardware. Although this has been available on ATI cards since the ATI Radeon 8500 in
       2001, tessellation shaders were recently standardized and made part of OpenGL 4.0.
